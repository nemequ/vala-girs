		 *  1. Any subclass looks at all properties it contains, and loads their initial values from the keys they represent.
		 *     Because Vala properties are stored as GLib properties, the string representation of a property replaces underscores with
		 *     hyphens (i.e. property_name becomes "property-name"). This is how this library knows which keys to load from. If the key
		 *     does not exist, it will result in a fatal error.
		 *  1. When a property of the subclass changes, the library will first verify the data before emitting a changed signal. If necessary,
		 *     the library will change the value of the property while verifying.
		 *     This is why developers should only act upon emissions of the changed () signal and never the native {@link GLib.Object.notify} signal.
		 *  1. When the corresponding key of one of the properties of the subclass changes, it will also verify the data and change it, if necessary,
		 *     before loading it into as the corresponding property's value.

		 * A widget that can display a list of items organized in categories.
		 *
		 * The source list widget consists of a collection of items, some of which are also expandable (and
		 * thus can contain more items). All the items displayed in the source list are children of the widget's
		 * root item. The API is meant to be used as follows:
		 *
		 * 1. Create the items you want to display in the source list, setting the appropriate values for their
		 * properties. The desired hierarchy is achieved by creating expandable items and adding items to them.
		 * These will be displayed as descendants in the widget's tree structure. The expandable items that are
		 * not nested inside any other item are considered to be at root level, and should be added to
		 * the widget's root item.<<BR>>
		 *
		 * Expandable items located at the root level are treated as categories, and only support text.
		 *
		 * ''Example''<<BR>>
		 * The final tree will have the following structure:
		 * {{{
		 * Libraries
		 *   Music
		 * Stores
		 *   My Store
		 *      Music
		 *      Podcasts
		 * Devices
		 *   Player 1

		 * var device_category = new Granite.Widgets.SourceList.ExpandableItem ("Devices");
		 *
		 * var music_item = new Granite.Widgets.SourceList.Item ("Music");
		 *
		 * // "Libraries" will be the parent category of "Music"
		 * library_category.add (music_item);
		 *
		 * // We plan to add sub-items to the store, so let's use an expandable item
		 * var my_store_item = new Granite.Widgets.SourceList.ExpandableItem ("My Store");
		 * store_category.add (my_store_item);
		 *
		 * var my_store_podcast_item = new Granite.Widgets.SourceList.Item ("Podcasts");
		 * var my_store_music_item = new Granite.Widgets.SourceList.Item ("Music");
		 *
		 * my_store_item.add (my_store_music_item);
		 * my_store_item.add (my_store_podcast_item);
		 *
		 * var player1_item = new Granite.Widgets.SourceList.Item ("Player 1");
		 * var player2_item = new Granite.Widgets.SourceList.Item ("Player 2");
		 *
		 * device_category.add (player1_item);
		 * device_category.add (player2_item);
		 * }}}
		 *
		 * 2. Create a source list widget.<<BR>>
		 * {{{
		 * var source_list = new Granite.Widgets.SourceList ();
		 * }}}
		 *
		 * 3. Add root-level items to the {@link Granite.Widgets.SourceList.root} item.
		 * This item only serves as a container, and all its properties are ignored by the widget.
		 *
		 * {{{
		 * // This will add the main categories (including their children) to the source list. After
		 * // having being added to be widget, any other item added to any of these items
		 * // (or any other child item in a deeper level) will be automatically added too.
		 * // There's no need to deal with the source list widget directly.
		 *
		 * var root = source_list.root;
		 *
		 * root.add (library_category);
		 * root.add (store_category);
		 * root.add (device_category);
		 * }}}
		 *
		 * The steps mentioned above are enough for initializing the source list. Future changes to the items'
		 * properties are ''automatically'' reflected by the widget.
		 *
		 * Final steps would involve connecting handlers to the source list events, being
		 * {@link Granite.Widgets.SourceList.item_selected} the most important, as it indicates that
		 * the selection was modified.
		 *
		 * It is strongly recommended to pack the source list into the GUI using the
		 * {@link Granite.Widgets.ThinPaned} widget. It has aesthetic advantages and offers a wider
		 * re-size handle than {@link Gtk.Paned}. This is usually done as follows:
